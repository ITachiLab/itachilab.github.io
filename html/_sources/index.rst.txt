Welcome to my knowledge base!
=============================

This is a half-personal, half-public knowledge base where I'm gathering articles of various kinds. This is done mainly for myself, so I can quickly recall my cool ideas from the past, but also for other seekers of unusual knowledge.

Some of the articles are ancient, written a couple of years ago when I was younger and had more time. Although they might be outdated, I still decided to keep them, just because of nostalgia, and for the pure sake of keeping my stuff together.
